## What is Syncbase?

### The Problem

When you watch a video on YouTube or any other video platform, the interaction between the creator and the viewer is through commenting, liking, disliking, watching the actual uploaded video etc. But there is something lacking here. There are creators who upload videos of themselves reacting to other videos or content that they cannot show in the video or at least not fully in high quality. For example when someone uploads a video of themselves reacting to an anime episode they simply can't display the whole episode or at all in the video because of copyright reasons. One way some creators tries to solve this is by linking to a different website where the viewer can watch the same video in higher quality or ideally without any editing of the content that they're reacting to. But this is not good user experience to just redirect them off to somewhere else that may not solve the problem completely. It would be great if there was a way for the creator to fully express everything that they want to tell the viewer. Like listening to music, watching videos, copyrighted or not.

### A Solution

Imagine YouTube but with the added ability to synchronize the actions of the creator with the viewer. The way to perform this synchronization would be to have a dedicated desktop application that records the actions (keystrokes) performed against some third party application that the creator wishes too synchronize with the viewer, all while the creator is recording the video. Call this dedicated desktop appliation, the synchronizer. This recording of keystrokes have to be perfectly aligned with the moments in the video where the actions are performed. Before the viewer chooses to watch the video, the viewer has to register the synchronizer with the third party application that the creator had in mind. In this instance, the synchronizer will execute the exact same actions which were recorded by the creator on the third party application as the video is playing on the viewers computer. In this way the viewer doesn't just watch the video but also experiences the same actions as the creator makes in that video on the viewer's own computer. This is what Syncbase is going to become.
